The problem here is due to the absence of hashcode method in employee class.
In line number 20, when !tracker.contains(e) is called it returns false because the default implementation of public int hashCode() returns distinct integers for distinct objects. 
So the default implementation will return two different integers for two same employees! I overridden the default hashcode implementation to fix this.
