First we know that       
        p1 is instanceOf PersonWithJob and Person 
        p2 is instanceOf Person
        

    because of polymorphism
        System.out.println("p1.equals(p2)? " + p1.equals(p2));
            calls for equals method inside PersonWithJob
                which checks 
                    p2 == null  --> not null
                    p2 isnot instanceOf PersonWithJob --> it isn't --> return false


        and 
		System.out.println("p2.equals(p1)? " + p2.equals(p1));
            calls for equals method inside Person
                which checks 
                    p1 == null --> not null
                    p1 isn't instanceOf Person --> is instanceOf Person
                    p2.name == p1.name ---> YES
                    returns True

Generally the reason this is happening is 
    because of polymorphism each object is calling different methods and 
    each object is instanceOf PersonWithJob or isn't
